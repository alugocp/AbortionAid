      <p>Welcome to our site! Here we aim to connect women of all circumstances to appropriate abortion, contraception, or child-bearing resources.</p>
      <p>This site also serves as an educational resources on abortion and its alternatives, and why people may choose to get an abortion or not.</p>
      <p>Lastly, this site allows people to donate to multiple different abortion aid organizations.</p>

      <subtitle>Rationale</subtitle>
      <p>The mission of this site is simple: to connect women to whatever resources they may need when they decide to get an abortion or keep their pregnancy. But why launch this site now? Well, the US government (as of early 2017) has reimplemented the "gag rule." This rule prevents federally funded doctors from discussing abortion with their patients. They cannot tell women where to get abortions from, nor can they provide information on the procedure itself.</p>
      <p>That's where our mission comes in. This site isn't federally funded, so it's unaffected by the gag rule. Its purpose is to fill the role that doctors usually would. The internet is a powerful tool that can be leveraged to distribute information, so why not use it to counteract the gag rule? If enough women learn of this site's mission, then the gag rule will lose its potency.</p>

      <subtitle>Pro-Life vs. Pro-Choice</subtitle>
      <col>
        <p>Pro-life means you believe abortion should be outlawed. No matter the situation, a woman who is pregnant must go through with the pregnancy. Oftentimes people choose to be pro-life for religious reasons or because they fear people will use abortion as a form of contraception (they think people will purposefully have unprotected sex and then use abortion to terminate their pregnancy).</p>
      </col>
      <col>
        <p>Pro-choice means you believe abortions should be legal, and that women should be able to choose whether or not they have an abortion. People usually choose to be pro-choice because they understand that many pregnancies are a result of rape, can result in the mother's death, or that the parent(s) may not be able to take care of the child.</p>
      </col>

      <subtitle>Alternatives to Abortion</subtitle>
      <p>There are several alternatives to abortion, depending on your paticular circumstances. Listed below are a few of these alternatives:</p><br></br>
      <p><b>• Contraception:</b> If you haven't become pregnant yet, then consider using this preventive alternative to abortion. Contraception comes in many forms, condoms being the cheapest, easiest and most readily available. Other forms of contraception includes birth control pills, spermicides, implants, sponges and diaphragms. If you can avoid an unwanted pregnancy by using contraception, then you won't need an abortion to begin with. The main downside to contraception is that most current methods involve a shot or implant, or mess with a woman's hormone levels.</p><br></br>
      <p><b>• Adoption:</b> Pro-life supporters believe abortion isn't neccessary because we have adoption. While it is a valid alternative to abortion, it does'nt work in all cases. If complications in a woman's pregnancy put her at increased risk of death, then adoption is not plausible. If the mother feels she will not be able to cope with giving up her child to adoption, then adoption is not plausible. This only becomes a viable option when the mother's pregnancy is healthy and she is willing to give her child up for adoption.</p>

      <subtitle>Why Are Abortions Necessary?</subtitle>
      <p>At first abortion may seem like a terrible idea, why would someone ever abort a pregnancy? Well, abortions are in fact quite necessary. Abortions give women control over unwanted or potentially fatal pregnancies. Some women cannot afford to take care of a child or to even be pregnant for a full 9 months. Maternal leave in the United States isn't on par with its European counterpart. A woman in her later stages of pregnancy is (in many cases) unable to come in to work for months at a time, and paid maternal leave in the US doesn't cover that long of an absence.</p><br></br>
      <p>Another reason someone would want to abort their pregnancy is because the pregnancy may kill them. Pregnancy really is one of the most beautiful, complex biological processes on our planet. Because of its complexity however, it can be complicated by scores of different factors. Even if a mother has no history whatsoever of alcohol, drugs or tobacco, her own body may negatively affect her pregnancy. Maybe she has a genetic mutation that affects the functionality of her uterus? Many women do. In many cases, these complications can negatively affect the fetus's development. They may end in death for the fetus, the mother, or even both. The only way to avoid these tragedies caused by the complications of birth is to abort one's pregnancy.</p><br></br>
      <p>Lastly, many women who become pregnant didn't even intend on having a child. Unfortunately it doesn't take consent to fertilize an egg, rape can impregnate a woman too. Rape is a terrible occurance in our modern time, and until it stops completely abortions will be a necessity for women around the world. You could tell couples to control their sexuality and avoid unwanted pregnancies, but abortions would still be necessary simply because of rape, economic strain, and complications of birth. For any of you who are religious, I suggest you pray to end these burdens instead of attacking abortion.</p>

      <subtitle>Factors in Your Decision</subtitle>
      <p><b>• Pregnancy Health:</b> A major factor in your decision should be the health of your pregnancy. If your pregnancy is unhealthy (if it puts you at an abnormally high risk of death), then it may be wise to get an abortion.</p>
      <p><b>• Cause of pregnancy</b> Was this pregnancy intended or not? If it wasn't, you may want to consider getting an abortion.</p>

    <row>
      <subtitle>Non-factors</subtitle>
      <p><b>• Money:</b> In an ideal world, money truly wouldn't be a factor. Whether you wanted to get the abortion or keep your pregnancy, you'd be able to pay for it. Unfortunately this isn't an ideal world, but this website may help you find financial aid no matter what you decide to do with your abortion.</p>
      <p><b>• Religion:</b> Religion should not affect your decision to have an abortion or not. You are the mother. You are the one who may be at increased risk of death. It is your decision, not the decision of your religious leader(s) or peers.</p>
